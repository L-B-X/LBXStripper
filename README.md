# LBXStripper
Lua Reascript for Reaper to create custom channel strips

Installation instructions:
Download both LBXCS_resources.zip and LBX Stripper.Lua files.

Create a folder in the reaper repository/Scripts folder called LBX
Within this folder unpack the LBXCS_resources zip file

Place the LBX Stripper.Lua file somewhere within the LBX folder

Open the LBX Stripper.Lua script in Reaper

Then...

Suss out how to use it until I have time to create more detailed instructions :)

This is a beta version.  More functionality will be added, things will change - I will try to keep all changes compatible with older versions - but in some cases this may not be possible - so bear in mind if you incorporate it into important projects.
