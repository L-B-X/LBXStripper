# LBXStripper
Lua Reascript for Reaper to create custom channel strips

Installation instructions:
Download both LBXCS_resources.zip and LBX Stripper.Lua files.  It seems best to download the RAW text format for the .lua file.  Some people report errors when downloading the file as it is.

Create a folder in the reaper repository/Scripts folder called LBX
Within this folder unpack the LBXCS_resources zip file

Place the LBX Stripper.Lua file somewhere within the LBX folder

Open the LBX Stripper.Lua script in Reaper

If you get any errors opening the script - please try copying and pasting the code direct from Github into a new script in Reaper - as my last script (Chaos Engine) had some reports of the downloaded .lua file not working - even though the code was fine.  This may be a me not knowing how to use github thing (perhaps an encoding problem with the lua file on github).



Then...

Suss out how to use it until I have time to create more detailed instructions :)

This is a beta version.  More functionality will be added, things will change - I will try to keep all changes compatible with older versions - but in some cases this may not be possible - so bear in mind if you incorporate it into important projects.

You may get some indication on how things work in this video - but bear in mind this version was a very early alpha version - and things have changed somewhat since then.
